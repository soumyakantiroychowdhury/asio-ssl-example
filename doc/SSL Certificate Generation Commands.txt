================== CA ================== 
1. Generate private key
$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out myCA.key 2048
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
....................+++
........+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
Enter pass phrase for myCA.key:
Verifying - Enter pass phrase for myCA.key:

2. Generate CA certificate
$ openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key myCA.key -sha256 -days 1825 -out myCA.pem
Enter pass phrase for myCA.key:
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
