# Boost Asio SSL Client and Server - Two Way Certificate Exchange and Verification

Changes made in the Boost Asio Client and Server example files (https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/doc/html/boost_asio/examples/cpp03_examples.html#boost_asio.examples.cpp03_examples.ssl) so that both server and client present their certificate during the TLS Handshake process and verify the certificate of the peer.
